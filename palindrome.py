# You have to write a program that, when run, asks the user to input some text. It can be a phrase, a sentence, or multiple sentences. After it is entered, your program will let the user know if it is a palindrome or not. Use "is a palindrome" and "is not a palindrome" in your output in order for the tests to pass.

# Letter casing and punctuation do not matter when testing a palindrome. All of the following are valid palindromes:

# stunt nuts
# Lisa Bonet ate no basil.
# A man, a plan, a cat, a ham, a yak, a yam, a hat, a canal: Panama!
# Doc, note, I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod.
